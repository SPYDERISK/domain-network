http://it-innovation.soton.ac.uk/ontologies/trustworthiness/domain,NETWORK,"Network domain model designed to support physical and virtual networks and applications running on them. Version 5 introduces service disablement contingency plans and attacker overrides, location/network contexts for malicious access, and construction of localised infrastructure in data centres and cellular networks. Attack paths are now restricted to remain within reach of the context for the initial breach, and respect asset and capability (enabled/disabled) status while allowing for attacker overrides where control can be established. Version 6 adds models for remote access to hosts by users running interactive processes, updated data lifecycle inference including remote user interactions with data, and improved modelling error threats covering common mistakes or ambiguities, along with several enhancements supporting new system modeller functionality including best- and worst-case as well as average threat and effect likelihoods in conjunction with asset populations.",http://it-innovation.soton.ac.uk/ontologies/trustworthiness/domain-network,uk.ac.soton.itinnovation.security.domainreasoner.NullReasoner
